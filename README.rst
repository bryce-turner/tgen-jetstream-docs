Welcome to Jetstream's documentation!
=====================================

**Jetstream** is a pipeline development framework written as a pure Python package
and command-line utility. It supports complex workflows modeled as directed-
acyclic graphs (DAGs), and execution on batch schedulers (Slurm).

Check out the :doc:`usage` section for further information, including
how to :ref:`installation` the project.
